DISCURSO DO MINISTRO DAS RELAÇÕES EXTERIORES, MAURO
VIEIRA, POR OCASIÃO DO DEBATE ABERTO NO CONSELHO DE
SEGURANÇA DAS NAÇÕES UNIDAS: “ SOLUÇÃO DE CONFLITOS
NO ORIENTE MÉDIO E NORTE DA ÁFRICA E COMBATE À
AMEAÇA TERRORISTA NA REGIÃO” (NOVA YORK/EUA,
30/09/2015)
Thank you, Mr. President.
I congratulate you for convening this
open debate and for bringing us
together to discuss the serious
challenges that the world face today to
promote peace and stability in the
Middle East and North Africa. We also
appreciate that the conceptual note
prepared by the Russian Federation
encourages a more in-depth reflection
on the primary causes of conflicts and
terrorism.
The threats to international peace and
security in the Middle East and North
Africa have been a recurring topic in
this Council. The increase in the
number and complexity of threats in
those two strategic regions attests to
our collective inability to solve long-
lasting conflicts and to prevent the
outbreak of new ones.
As Brazil has consistently upheld in
this Council, we must address those
problems
by
conceiving
an
overarching strategy based on the
combination of diplomacy and
peacebuilding efforts.
Last year we witnessed the third tragic
war in five years in Gaza. The peace
process
between
Israelis
and
Palestinians has remained stalled.
Violence reached unimaginable levels
of brutality in Syria and the prospects
for resolving the conflict remain
elusive. The so-called “Islamic State”
took control of large parts of Iraq and
Syria and has been perpetrating the
most barbaric crimes against innocent
civilians. Both Libya and Yemen are
falling into a spiral of political disputes
and violence, resulting in destruction
and serious humanitarian crises.
Let me state in no uncertain terms
Brazil’s utmost repudiation for all
forms of terrorism and extremism.
There are simply no justifiable grounds
for terrorist acts. The Brazilian
Government was appalled by the acts
of provocation that resulted in the
senseless destruction of cultural and
historic heritage in Syria, Iraq, Mali
and elsewhere.
It should be noted that the common
trait to all those situations is the
international community’s failure in
dealing with the underlying causes of
conflicts. As long as we disregard
poverty and the fragility of national
institutions as drivers of armed
conflict, there will no lasting solution
in sight. We have seen time and again the
harmful effects of bending the rules
and invoking exceptional rights in
order to justify military interventions.
Those strategies have enfeebled the
multilateral system and aggravated the
situation on the ground. Iraq and Libya
are two clear examples of the failure of
any approach based on the vicious
cycle of threats, sanctions and
violence.
Military interventions led only to weak
national
institutions,
increased
sectarianism, power vacuums and arms
proliferation, paving the way for the
rise of radical groups such as the
“Islamic State”. Those groups thrive in
the absence of the State and benefit
from the flow of weapons to non-State
actors.
It is high time that the Security
Council assesses the inventory of
preventable tragedies and learn from
past mistakes. We should be all
committed to demonstrate our resolve
to focus on political dialogue and
preventive actions. The use of
sanctions and military force should
always be the last resort and, when it
so happens, it must be in line with the
provisions of the UN Charter. What we
really need is better diplomacy to face
the numerous challenges that still lie
ahead.
Mr. President,
61
The humanitarian tragedy that emerged
from the conflicts in the Middle East
and North Africa remains a matter of
great concern. We commend the work
done by the United Nations agencies
and its partners to help millions of
people in need, as well as the
outstanding generosity of many
countries in the region, including
Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt,
which have been receiving the bulk of
Syrian refugees.
Brazil has been striving to contribute
to these humanitarian efforts. We have
issued more than 7,700 entry visas for
Syrian residents affected by the crisis
and provided food and medicine to
help alleviate the dire situation faced
by refugees and displaced people in the
region. As President Dilma Rousseff
pledged before the 70th General
Assembly, Brazil will continue to host
those who had to flee their home
country and need a place to restart
their lives. As the home of the largest
Syrian diaspora in the world, and a
country committed to international
peace and security, Brazil is ready to
shoulder its responsibilities in the
diplomatic and humanitarian fronts.
Even in light of those tragic facts, there
is still reason for hope. Hope generated
by a renewed belief in the virtues of
diplomacy. The Joint Comprehensive
Plan of Action regarding the Iranian
nuclear program and the Syrian
chemical
weapons
resolutions
demonstrate that, when political will is
present, reaching agreement is possible even on complex and highly sensitive
issues
Brazil commends all those involved in
those efforts and their persistence in
dialogue and negotiation. This set a
positive trend that should help us to
effectively address the ongoing
conflicts in the region. We should look
up to these examples of successful
diplomatic engagement and redouble
our collective efforts to halt and settle
the conflicts in the Middle East.
Peace talks between Israel and
Palestine must be urgently resumed
under parameters that could lead to a
two-State solution. There can be no
more delay in achieving an inclusive
political solution in Syria. A first step
to encourage dialogue and avoid the
aggravation of conflict should be
halting the flow of arms into the
country. We look forward to a renewed
political process, led by the UN, to
deal with the situation in Syria. Brazil
wishes for a territorially united,
sovereign, plural, and democratic Syria
to emerge from the ashes of war.
In Libya and Yemen, the international
community should be united in
condemning violence, avoiding the use
of unilateral force and working with
the parties to promote dialogue, bridge
differences and reach a peaceful and
durable solution. Mr. President, Diplomacy,
cooperation
and
multilateralism should guide us in the
quest for a more stable and peaceful
Middle East and North Africa. This
Council has the primary responsibility
in encouraging political dialogue and
in addressing the root causes of
conflicts. It is our duty to restore the
Council ́s capacity to fulfill its duties
in upholding international peace and
security.
The Council ́s effectiveness and
continued authority require that it be
viewed
as
legitimate
and
representative. After 70 years of work,
a reformed Security Council, with new
permanent
and
non-permanent
members, would be better positioned
to adequately address the challenges of
a multipolar world and lead a new
phase of active diplomatic engagement
to resolve those disputes. The
opportunity is before us. One needs to
look no further than to the situations
mentioned in this debate to realize how
urgent this task is.
Since 1945, Brazil has been an
enthusiast of multilateralism and
everything the UN stands for. We hope
that in the next 70 years – and beyond
– the international community lives up
to the promise enshrined in the UN
Charter to rid future generations of the
scourges of war and all forms of
meaningless suffering.
Thank you very much
