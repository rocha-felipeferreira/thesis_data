Partners for a new world Vision”

As BRICS countries meet in New Delhi
today, it is with great satisfaction - and high
expectations - that i visit india for the frst time
as President of Brazil. Geographically distant
from each other, our countries share unique
experiences. Both of them are multicultural,
multi-ethnic, multi-religious and democratic
nations. But that is not all. The gigantic internal
process of social ascension that led tens of
millions of families into the consumer market,
by creating opportunities for all, has made
India and Brazil examples for the world. In
a time when economic crisis, unemployment
and recession are on the agenda, Brazil and
India stand out as growth models.
This is the framework in which i had
the satisfaction to accept Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh’s invitation to pay a
state visit to India, after the BRICS summit
meeting. It will be a privilege to represent
Brazil as a guest of the government of India
and to pay my tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, the
symbol of a revolutionary vision in asserting
national identity.
This visit will allow our countries to
consolidate a substantive bilateral agenda
and to strengthen similar foreign policy
principles, including the staunch defence of
the interests of our poorest populations, the
promotion of sustainable economic growth
and an independent international position that
is coherent with the new world order.
These are reasons why Brazil and
India strongly converge for the reform of
international organisations, whether it is
expansion of the UN Security Council and the
creation of a new responsibility model within
the IMF, or the establishment of new highlevel forums, such as G20, IBSA, BASIC
and BRICS, whose fourth summit meeting is
taking place in New Delhi.
This current meeting of the leaders of
Brazil, Russia, India, China and South
Africa is an undeniable demonstration of
how geographically distant countries, with
different social and economic challenges, can
become partners and generate a convergence
that changes the axis of international politics.
BRICS contain roughly a third of the world’s
population and a ffth of its GdP. Our
economies and markets can strongly beneft
from one another. Trade among BRICS rose
from $27 billion in 2002 to $212 billion in
2010. This year it may reach $250 billion.
BRICS will be responsible for 56% of world
growth in 2012. In this forum, Brazil and India have been sharing their points of view
and expanding their partnerships.
Brazil and India have had diplomatic
relations since 1948, but only in the 21st
century has our integration truly begun. In this
period, our countries have signed more than
30 bilateral agreements, in felds ranging from
science to trade. Indian-Brazilian trade rose
from under $500 million in 1999 to $9.3 billion
in 2011 - an increase of almost 2,000%. This
makes India our 12th largest trade partner - a
relevant position that, however, is obviously
not reﬂective of our economies’ dynamism.
There still is much to be done.
Recently, Embrapa (Brazilian Agricultural
Research Corporation) and the Indian Council
of Agricultural Research have sealed a
partnership for the exchange of experience in
the strategic sectors of food production and
biotechnology research. knowing Embrapa’s
successful work in seedling selection and
expansion of production in regions with
climate and soil similar to India’s, i am
positive this partnership will bear fruit for
both countries.
In the defence area, a pioneer project
integrating our technologies is currently
underway: the installation of Indian airborne
radars onto Brazilian Embraer-145 airplanes.
The maiden ﬂight of the frst aircraft will take
place in less than one month. In the health
sector, we have been carrying out joint projects,
through the Indo-Brazilian Science Council,
in areas such as parasitology (leishmaniasis
and malaria), microbiology (tuberculosis) and
virology ( HIv/AIDS).
Among the great examples India has
given the world recently, the quality leap in
education and scientifc research, especially
in information technology, has drawn much
attention. For this reason, this offcial visit
will be a great opportunity for Brazil to sign an
agreement with India under my government’s
programme ‘Science without Borders’, which
will make it possible for Brazilian teachers
and students to study in Indian universities.
Likewise, the doors of our teaching institutions
will remain open for Indian academics. It is
also our goal to increase the ﬂow of tourists,
so that more Indians and Brazilians can have
the opportunity to enjoy each other’s natural
beauty, unique cuisines and the joy of our
peoples.
During this visit, we intend to foster our
converging interests in other areas, such as
environmental issues. The Convention on
Biological Diversity, to be held in India, and
the United Nations Conference on Sustainable
Development Rio+20, to be held in Brazil, are
rare opportunities for our countries to show
their commitment to sustainable economic
development, which protects the environment
and expedites the social inclusion of the
poorest.
Brazil and India are two emerging, dynamic
economies committed to the challenge of
combining sustainable economic growth with
income distribution and social inclusion. Our
countries have come a long way in the recent
past. The fact that our association has become
so much more intense in the same period is by
no means just a happy coincidence. Although
physically distant, Brazil and India are
strategic partners for a new world vision. One
that is inclusive, sovereign and democratic.
