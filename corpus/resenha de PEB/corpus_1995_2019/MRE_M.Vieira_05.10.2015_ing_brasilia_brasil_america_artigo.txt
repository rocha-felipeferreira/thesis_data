BRAZIL: CUTTING EMISSIONS
BY
FIGHTING
DEFORESTATION (THE JAPAN
TIMES – OCT 5TH, 2015)
[INGLÊS]
05 de outubro de 2015 - Mauro Vieira, Minister of Foreign
Affairs of Brazil BRASILIA – As we approach the
conference on climate change to be
held in Paris in December (COP-21),
perhaps the most intriguing question
we might ask is this: Which country
has made the largest reductions in its
greenhouse gases emissions? Several
scientific papers point to a clear
answer: Brazil. With an impressive 41 percent
reduction in emissions since 2005, the
country has kept more than 3 billion
tons of carbon dioxide out of the
atmosphere. Should the entire U.S.
transport sector — including cars,
trucks, trains, ships, airplanes and
other vehicles — switch to renewables,
it would take almost two years to
achieve a similar reduction.
More than 20 years after the
establishment of the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate
Change
(UNFCCC),
scientific
evidence of climate change has
increased substantially, the issue has
become a political priority in most
countries, several economic solutions
have been proposed and public
awareness has never been higher. And
yet, reducing emissions remains a
daunting challenge. In most of the world, energy and
transportation are the main sources of
emissions. In spite of marginal gains
— for instance, by means of improved
energy efficiency — no country has
put forth such a “game changer” in
terms of the main sources of emissions as Brazil, which has managed to
address what was until recently its
primary
source
of
emissions:
deforestation. On a global scale, deforestation
accounts for less than 10 percent of
emissions. With an emissions profile
so different from the rest of the world,
Brazil had to find its own way to fight
it. Thus, in Copenhagen (2009), when
Brazil pledged to reduce deforestation
by 80 percent between 2005 and 2020,
almost nobody believed it was
possible, despite the fact that progress
was already under way. After all, how
could a developing country, facing so
many other challenges, achieve such
an unprecedented feat? The critics and naysayers were rapidly
proved wrong. As early as 2009, the
Nature Conservancy, one of the
world’s
leading
environmental
nonprofit organizations, called Brazil a
“responsible agricultural superpower,”
highlighting the effectiveness of its
certification system for agriculture
crops in reducing deforestation. The
involvement of local communities was
a key element in this effort, which has
been supported by one of the world’s
most engaged civil societies. Indeed,
three out of four Brazilians are “very
concerned” with climate change, the
second-highest proportion among 40
countries recently surveyed by the Pew
Research Center. Other bold policies — such as the
increase in protected areas and
regulations on which crops can be
cultivated where — have helped curb
deforestation. The success of these
efforts quickly made its way to the
headlines. In 2013, the Financial Times suggested that after decades of
deforestation, Brazil’s policies might
be turning the Amazon into a “paradise
regained.” Also in 2013, the
Economist described how Brazil was
“using education, technology and
politics to save its rain forest,” and the
following year, it concluded that the
country had become “the world leader
in
reducing
environmental
degradation.”
In due course, the scientific
community decided to scrutinize
Brazil’s policies in order to assess their
results. The conclusions have been
unequivocal: In 2014, Science
published an article in which 17
scientists analyzed how Brazil was
successfully
“slowing
Amazon
deforestation through public policy and
interventions in beef and soy supply
chains.” In 2015 it was Nature that put
forth an in-depth study leading to the
conclusion, published in an editorial,
that “the world must follow Brazil’s
lead and do more to protect and restore
forests.” Also this year, a study by
researchers from Brazil and Germany,
supported
by
the
European
Commission, found that “Brazil is
considered to possess the most
advanced deforestation monitoring and
enforcement infrastructure.”
The recognition of Brazil’s success in
tackling its main source of emissions
by
the
international
scientific
community is very good news — but
challenges persist. To remain vigilant,
Brazil has established the Amazon
Fund, a pioneering, results-based
initiative that seeks funding for
projects
that
have
already
demonstrated their effectiveness in
reducing emissions. The fund is fully
381
consistent with REDD+, which was
established by the Climate Change
Convention to reduce emissions from
deforestation and forest degradation as
well as to enhance forest carbon stocks
in developing countries.
Norway has been the first country to
join the Amazon Fund, pledging $1
billion, and is very positive about it: In
a report assessing the country’s
initiatives on international climate, the
Norwegian Agency for Development
Cooperation stated that “Brazil’s
deforestation rate and corresponding
greenhouse gas emissions have
strongly decreased” and that the
performance-based
activities
established under the Amazon Fund
“are paving the way for future
emissions reductions.” Germany has
also contributed to the fund and in her
latest visit to Brazil, Chancellor
Angela Merkel announced that
“Germany will further contribute to the
Amazon Fund, enhancing the results
based payments under the REDD+.”
Meanwhile, the Overseas Development
Institute (ODI), the United Kingdom’s
leading independent think tank on
international development, has carried
out its own independent review of the
fund, with quite positive assessments.
As
the
world’s
second-largest
developed and developing economies,
respectively, Japan and Brazil are
expected to actively engage in
promoting sustainable development.
Japan has been very clear about the
immense challenges in reducing its
own emissions, but it is clearly
committed to supporting the global
fight against climate change, as
illustrated by its contribution to the
Green Climate Fund (which is a powerful tool for promoting REDD+).
Brazil, on its side, is conscious of the
challenges it will continue to face in
protecting its forests and the
livelihoods of those living there and it
expects that the examples of Norway
and Germany will be followed by other
developed countries. Our two countries
share a long history of friendship,
including
cooperation
in
third
countries. The preservation of forests
can be a promising new frontier for
bilateral and trilateral cooperation.
