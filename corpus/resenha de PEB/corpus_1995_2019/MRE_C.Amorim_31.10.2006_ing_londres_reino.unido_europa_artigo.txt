Climate change is due only in small part to
changes in land use, including deforestation
Recently there have been frequent newspaper
references to the interest shown by foreign individuals,
institutions and even governments in initiatives aimed
at acquiring land in the Amazon region for
conservation purposes. Such initiatives arise from
concerns regarding the possible role of deforestation
in climate change. However, they are also based on
a lack of information regarding the Amazon rainforest,
and ignore important scientific data.
Climate change is a genuine problem, and one
to which Brazil attaches great importance. There is a
global consensus that the phenomenon is being
accelerated by human actions. It is a cumulative
process, resulting from the progressive concentration
of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the last
150 years, so it is wrong and unfair to focus attention
primarily on countries’ present emissions. Some of
the countries currently producing emissions -
particularly in the developing world - have little or no
historical responsibility for global warming.
The main cause of climate change is well
known: at least 80 per cent of the problem is a
consequence of the burning of fossil fuels - especially
coal and oil - from the mid-19th century onwards. It
is due only in small part to changes in land use,
including deforestation.
There are many reasons why current levels
of deforestation around the world are a cause for

concern, but in combating climate change the focus
should be on altering energy matrixes and promoting
more intensive use of clean energy. The UN Climate
Change Convention and its Kyoto Protocol are quite
clear on this point: those who caused the problem -
the industrialised countries - must meet mandatory
reduction targets and have the obligation to act first.
Although not obliged to meet any mandatory
reduction targets, since it bears little responsibility for
the problem, Brazil is doing its part. We have one of
the cleanest energy matrixes in the world. Our bio-
fuels programmes are often quoted as an example to
be followed by other countries. We are therefore
contributing to sustainable development and to the
reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions.
Brazil is also fighting deforestation by
implementing policies aimed at promoting the value
of our native forest and supporting the socio-
economic development of communities that depend
on it. Over recent years we have achieved significant
reductions in the rate of deforestation in the Amazon.
The rate of deforestation from mid-2004 to mid-2005
was 32 per cent lower than over the previous twelve
months, and according to preliminary data there was
a further fall of 11 per cent in 2005-06. These are
important results, but the efforts towards a permanent
decrease in deforestation must continue.
Sustainable forest management is an area with
a great deal of potential for international co-operation
through the exchange of experiences and support for
technical capacity-building. We welcome such co-
operation, as long as it is based on respect for our
laws and our sovereignty.
Brazil is an active participant in the
international debate regarding forests. At the UN
Climate Change Conference in Nairobi in November
we will be putting forward a proposal aimed at
creating incentives for countries to reduce rates of
deforestation voluntarily, which we believe would also
be an appropriate way for developed countries to
support the conservation of tropical rainforests.
The proposal constitutes just one aspect of Brazil”s contribution to the shared efforts aimed at
reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. Brazil is
firmly opposed to the unsustainable development
patterns that have led to irreparable environmental
damage all over the world. Brazil expects the
industrialised countries, which are responsible for
these development patterns, to comply with their
obligations for reducing emissions.
In the developed world, well-meaning
individuals who are concerned about climate change,
with good reason, should dedicate themselves to
influencing their own governments with a view to
altering unsustainable patterns of production and
consumption and to utilising renewable energy sources.
The latter is an area in which Brazil has much to offer
in terms of expertise and technology.
We are taking care of the Amazon in
accordance with development models based on
principles of sustainability defined by Brazilian society.
The Amazon is part of the heritage of the Brazilian
people, and it is not for sale.
